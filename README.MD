    Project Setup
    Step 1: Clone the Repository
    Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opportunity-portal.git
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the required Node.js dependencies.

cd opportunity-portal
npm install
Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root and add your database connection details:


DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=opportunity_portal
Make sure to replace yourpassword with your actual MySQL password.

#Database Setup
        Step 1: Create the MySQL Database
        Open your MySQL Workbench and create a new database using the following command:


        CREATE DATABASE opportunity_portal;
        Step 2: Create Tables
        You will need to create the following tables:

        employers: Stores employer details.
        jobs: Stores job listings.
        candidates: Stores candidate profiles.
        applications: Tracks job applications.
        job_status: Updates the status of job applications.
        Here's an example of creating the employers table:

        sql
        Copy code
        CREATE TABLE employers (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
            password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        );
        Follow this pattern to create the other tables (jobs, candidates, applications, job_status).

#Frontend Setup
    Step 1: Design the Web Pages
    Ensure you have at least 10 fully responsive web pages, including:

    Home Page
    Login Page (Employer/Candidate)
    Employer Registration Form
    Candidate Registration Form
    Job Listings Page
    Employer Dashboard
    Candidate Dashboard
    Application Status Page
    About Us
    Contact Us
    Each page should follow consistent styling using SCSS for better maintainability.

Step 2: Form Validation
Use JavaScript to validate all forms, ensuring required fields are completed before submission. Include error handling for invalid inputs.

#Backend Setup
Step 1: Set Up Express Server
In the app.js file, set up an Express server that handles routing for the frontend forms and interacts with the MySQL database. Here's an example of handling login requests:


Step 2: Handle Form Submissions
For each form (Employer, Candidate, Job Listings), write routes that accept form data, validate it, and insert it into the corresponding MySQL table.

#Google Sheets Data Visualization
You can visualize your database data using Google Sheets for better insights. Export your MySQL data and upload it to Google Sheets.

Running the Project
Step 1: Start the MySQL Server
Make sure your MySQL server is running.

Step 2: Start the Node.js Server
Run the following command to start the server:


#Future Improvements
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure different permissions for employers and candidates.
Add job search filters by location, experience, and job type.
Build an API to allow third-party integrations.
